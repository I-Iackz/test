1. Unpack Java project Directory (SimmiProject)
2. Open IDE (Preferable Eclipse)
3. "Import Existing Project into Workspace"  - select root project directory (SimmiProject)
4. Test was developed on physical device "Huawei Pro P30+" (code capabilities would need updated to run from other device)
5. Test is run as java application from TestRunner.java 

Any Questions?
